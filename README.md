## Current Focus

🌍 Building **Vericarbon Protocol** for ETH Cape Town 2026  
HomeInv: Decentralized REIT tackling South African housing inequality through rent-to-equity smart contracts.
Vericarbon: Carbon credit marketplace with IoT/satellite verification and on-chain retirement registry.

## Featured Projects

All projects emphasize real-world data integration (no simulated sources) and production-grade Foundry test coverage.

### 🏘️ HomeInv Protocol (In Progress)
Decentralized REIT on zkSync Era bridging global liquidity and South African spatial justice. 
ERC-3643 compliance, rent-to-equity vaults, and Street Committee DAOs as community oracles.

### 🌱 Vericarbon Protocol *(In Progress)*
Carbon credit marketplace with automated verification via Chainlink oracles pulling data from NASA EMIT and OpenAQ APIs. Features ERC-1155 credits with vintage metadata, constant product AMM, and immutable retirement registry.

### ⚡ UGPT Protocol
Tokenizes energy facility processing fees from gas plants. Combines SCADA expertise with DeFi mechanics for automated revenue distribution to token holders based on real facility throughput data.

### 🛢️ Stratum Protocol  
Oil-backed stablecoin protocol with automated collateralization and price stability mechanisms using Chainlink Price Feeds. Designed for energy sector liquidity management.

### 📊 EnergyDEX
Real-time DEX arbitrage detection system for energy commodity trading. Monitors liquidity pools across multiple chains to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities.
