## Current Focus

🌍 Building **Vericarbon Protocol** for ETH Cape Town 2026  
Carbon credit marketplace with IoT/satellite verification, AMM price discovery, and on-chain retirement registry.

## Featured Projects

All projects emphasize real-world data integration (no simulated sources) and production-grade Foundry test coverage.

### 🌱 Vericarbon Protocol *(In Progress)*
Carbon credit marketplace with automated verification via Chainlink oracles pulling data from NASA EMIT and OpenAQ APIs. Features ERC-1155 credits with vintage metadata, constant product AMM, and immutable retirement registry.

### ⚡ UGPT Protocol
Tokenizes energy facility processing fees from gas plants. Combines SCADA expertise with DeFi mechanics for automated revenue distribution to token holders based on real facility throughput data.

### 🛢️ Stratum Protocol  
Oil-backed stablecoin protocol with automated collateralization and price stability mechanisms using Chainlink Price Feeds. Designed for energy sector liquidity management.

### 📊 EnergyDEX
Real-time DEX arbitrage detection system for energy commodity trading. Monitors liquidity pools across multiple chains to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities.
